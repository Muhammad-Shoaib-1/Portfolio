## About
This repo is a static HTML portfolio that showcases who I am, what I can do, and what I’ve built. It’s a snapshot of my digital identity: professional, yet vibey.


## Built With
- **HTML5** – The backbone of this entire site.  
- **(Future) CSS3/JS** – Currently minimal, but planning to add some sprinkle of styles and interactivity soon.  

_Pro Tip: It’s lightweight AF—just open in any modern browser and you’re golden._


## Getting Started

These are the basics to get a local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-waqas1/Portfolio.git

2. **Navigate into the folder**
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
3.  **Open index.html in your browser**
  Just double-click or right-click → “Open With” → your browser of choice.
    

That’s it. No npm installs, no build steps—just straight HTML.

## Usage

*   **Browse the site locally** by opening index.html.
    
*   **Deploy anywhere**: Copy all files to a static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) and you’re live.
    
*   **Mobile-friendly**: The layout is simple enough to be responsive with minor CSS tweaks (go ahead, experiment).
    

## Customization


Feel free to fork and flex! To make it your own:

1.  **Edit content**: Swap out text in each HTML file for your own bio, skills, and projects.
    
2.  **Replace images**: In assets/images/, swap in your own profile pic, logos, or screenshots—just keep the file paths consistent or update the  tags accordingly.
    
3.  **Add CSS/JS**: Make a new styles.css or script.js in an assets/ folder and link them in the or before .
    

_No crazy folder structure—just keep everything organized in /assets and you’ll be Gucci._
